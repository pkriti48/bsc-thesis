World "CountCharAndElemOf"
Title "CountChar and ElemOf"

Introduction "Welcome to **The CountChar and ElemOf World**!

In this world, you will study the behavior of the functions ```countCharInWord``` and ```elemOf```
in combination with the functions ```append``` and ```replicateChar```.

You will first prove that counting the occurrences of a character distributes over word append,
showing that counts from individual words are preserved and summed. You will then analyze how
character counting behaves in words formed by repeating a single character.

Finally, you will establish that character membership is preserved under appending, both when a
character appears in the left word and when it appears in the right word.

Let's get started!
